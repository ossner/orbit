# Orbit
A collection of (in my opinion) useful shell scripts that use the gum command line project to produce beautiful, easy-to-use tools that every developer needs.

## Git
Using [commit.gum](commit.gum), you can quickly write commits that adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specifications.

## Utility
[keygen.gum](keygen.gum) takes some of the labor out of generating ssh keys.
It will walk you through the different key types and provides a conventional way of naming the keys and adding them to the ssh config.

You can take these tools and amend them to whatever you want and fits your use-case. If you have another useful shell script that is in the same spirit, consider opening a pull request.
